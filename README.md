**Kitchen Engineer** — blending engineering logic with creative expression.

Welcome to my GitHub space.  
This repository serves as the central hub for my experiments, projects, and explorations across software development, system design, automation, and creative technology.

## 👋 About Me

I work at the intersection of:

- 💻 **Programming & Automation**
- 🤖 **Bots & System Tools**
- 🌐 **Web Design & Frontend Experiments**
- 🐧 **Linux, Minimal Systems & Custom Distros**
- 🎨 **Creative Interfaces & Visual Concepts**

I enjoy building things that are:
- Minimal but powerful  
- Functional yet aesthetic  
- Practical with a touch of personality
